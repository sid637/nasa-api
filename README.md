Nasa API with ajax

The NASA API is - https://api.nasa.gov/


In the documentation of the NASA API, 
you can see that the API also works with sol (Martian rotation or day) as input.
 taken 'sol' and 'page' as input.

In the project

we can traverse between the pages() using the buttons.
Initially, when the images are not loaded the two buttons provided to traverse are disabled. 
When the images are first loaded, one of the button becomes enabled. 
Going to the next page, makes both the buttons enabled.
And the other button becomes disabled when there are no more pages left.
